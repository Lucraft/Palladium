# Palladium 1.21 Addon Pack Update Primer


## Forge and NeoForge
With 1.21 I abandoned Forge and will solely support NeoForge (next to Fabric). A lot of other mods are doing so aswell, but you will not face any big differences because of this.
Mainly, every mention of "Forge" should be renamed to "NeoForge". This applies to the dependencies section in your pack.mcmeta, and the attributes added by Forge, which are now in the "neoforge" namespace.

## Attributes
Minecraft added a lot of attributes that were previously added by mods. You need to replace the following:

| Old                                    | New                                              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `forge:step_height_addition`           | `minecraft:generic.step_height`                  |
| `porting_lib:step_height_addition`     | `minecraft:generic.step_height`                  |
| `forge:entity_gravity`                 | `minecraft:generic.gravity`                      |
| `porting_lib:entity_gravity`           | `minecraft:generic.gravity`                      |
| `forge:block_reach`                    | `minecraft:player.block_interaction_range`       |
| `porting_lib:reach_distance`           | `minecraft:player.block_interaction_range`       |
| `reach-entity-attributes:reach`        | `minecraft:player.block_interaction_range`       |
| `forge:entity_reach`                   | `minecraft:player.entity_interaction_range`      |
| `porting_lib:attack_range`             | `minecraft:player.entity_interaction_range`      |
| `reach-entity-attributes:attack_range` | `minecraft:player.entity_interaction_range`      |
| `forge:swim_speed`                     | `neoforge:swim_speed` / `porting_lib:swim_speed` |



## KubeJS
KubeJS is sadly now only available on NeoForge, having abandoned Fabric. If you want to use KubeJS for your packs, you'll have to make your packs NeoForge-only.

If you have any pre-existing scripts you need to update, here are the things you need to update:

- The `PalladiumEvents.registerGuiOverlays` event has been changed to `PalladiumEvents.registerGuiLayer`. The parameters of the event have also been changed to `GuiGraphics guiGraphics, DeltaTracker deltaTracker`
- `player.powers`, `level.powers` have been removed. Use the helper objects within `palladium`
- If you used any of the following fields in your scripts, please replace them:

| Old              | New                     |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `superpowerUtil` | `palladium.superpowers` |
| `abilityUtil`    | `palladium.abilities`   |
| `animationUtil`  | `palladium.animations`  |
| `guiUtil`        | `palladium.gui`         |


## Misc Changes
Following things have had changes, please check their documentation files:
- Items (food properties to be exact)
- Armor Materials
- Tool Tiers
